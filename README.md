# Labeling Application

## Overview

Labeling is an innovative application designed to build a large dataset for various purposes. Unlike traditional methods where users watch ads to continue playing a game after losing, this application prompts users to take a photo of any object around them and label it. This photo and label data are then stored in our database, allowing us to gather a significant amount of data.

## Features

- **Game Continuation:** When the player loses and wants to continue, instead of watching an ad, they take a photo of an object and label it.
- **Data Collection:** The photos and their corresponding labels are collected and stored in a database, helping to create a large dataset.
- **User Engagement:** Engages users in a unique way, making data collection more interactive and less intrusive.
